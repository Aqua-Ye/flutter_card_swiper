# flutter_card_swiper

```flutter_card_swiper``` is a Flutter package for a Tinder Card Swiper. âœ¨

It allows swiping in all directions with any Custom Widget (Stateless or Statefull).

Very smooth animations supporting Android, iOS & WebApp.

## Why?

We build this package because we wanted to:

- have a complete customizable slider
- be able to swipe in every direction
- choose our own settings for the swiper such as duration, angle, padding..
- NEW: trigger swipe, swipe left and swipe right however we want
- NEW: add functions while un-/swiping, on end or when the swiper is disabled
- NEW: detect the direction (left, right, top, bottom) in which the card was swiped away

### Detect direction of swipe
We've added the direction in which the card was swiped away to the function ```onSwipe```. The  ```AppinioSwipeDirection``` gets now returned when the function gets called.

### Trigger swipe through controller
You can now trigger the swipe with our ```CardSwiperController```. You can call the ```swipe``` trough the controller anywhere you want. Just make sure to pass the controller to the parameter ```controller``` from our ```CardSwiper```.

## Installation

Create a new project with the command
```yaml

```
to your `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project.
**OR**
run

```yaml
flutter pub add card_swiper
```
in your project's root directory.


In your library add the following import:

```dart
card_swiperimport 'package:flutter_card_swiper/card_swiper.dart';
```

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Usage
You can place your `CardSwiper` inside of a `Scaffold` or `CupertinoPageScaffold` like we did here. Optional parameters can be defined to enable different features. See the following example..

```dart
card_swiperimport 'package:flutter_card_swiper/card_swiper.dart';
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';

class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  List<Container> cards = [
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('1'),
      color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
    ),
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('2'),
      color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
    ),
    Container(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: const Text('3'),
      color: CupertinoColors.activeBlue,
    )
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CupertinoPageScaffold(
      child: SizedBox(
        height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.75,
        child: CardSwiper(
          cards: cards,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

| duration      | 200 milliseconds    |   The duration that every animation should last | false
| maxAngle | 30      |    Maximum angle the card reaches while swiping | false
| threshold | 50     |    Threshold from which the card is swiped away | false
| isDisabled | false      |   Set to ```true``` if swiping should be disabled, has no impact when triggered from the outside | false
| onTapDisabled | -     |    Function that get triggered when the swiper is disabled | false

#### Controller

The ```Controller``` is used to control the ```swipe```, ```swipeLeft```, ```swipeRight``` function of the swiper from outside of the widget. You can create a controller called ```CardSwiperController``` and save the instance for further usage. Please have a closer look to our Example for the usage.

| Method        | Description
